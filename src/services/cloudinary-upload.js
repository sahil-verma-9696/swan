/**
 * Uploads a file to Cloudinary using a signed `multipart/form-data` POST request.
 *
 * This function:
 * 1. Fetches a signed upload signature from your backend for the specified folder.
 * 2. Constructs a `FormData` payload including the file and required Cloudinary parameters.
 * 3. Sends a `multipart/form-data` request directly to Cloudinary‚Äôs upload API.
 *
 * üîê **Note:** The signature must be generated on the backend using the same parameters
 * (e.g., `folder`, `timestamp`, and optionally `eager`) to ensure a valid upload.
 *
 * üì¶ **Important:** This request is sent as `multipart/form-data` which is required by
 * Cloudinary's file upload endpoint.
 *
 * @async
 * @function cloudinaryUpload
 * @param {Object} params - Upload parameters.
 * @param {File} params.file - The file (image/video) to upload.
 * @param {string} params.folder - The target Cloudinary folder to upload the file to.
 *
 * @throws {Error} If `file` or `folder` is missing.
 * @throws {Error} If the upload request fails.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} Cloudinary's JSON response on success.
 *   - `secure_url` {string}: The hosted URL of the uploaded file.
 *   - `public_id` {string}: Cloudinary's ID for the file.
 *   - `resource_type` {string}: Type of the file (`image`, `video`, etc.).
 *   - `eager` {Array} (optional): Transformed versions, if eager transformations were used.
